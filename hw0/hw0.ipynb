He grew up in a musical household, with his parents being both pianists and his father teaching piano lessons at the age of four. Mingus's early musical influences were diverse, ranging from blues and ragtime to jazz and classical music. He began playing the bass guitar at the age of six and by the time he was 14, he was already performing professionally in various bands in Cleveland.\n", "\n", "> Mingus's family moved to Los Angeles when he was a teenager, where he attended High School No. 1 and later went on to study at Claremont Men's College for two years before transferring to California State University, Long Beach (CSULB). It was during his time at CSULB that Mingus began to develop his musical skills, studying under the tutelage of composer and bandleader, Leonard Bernstein. After graduating from CSULB in 1946, Mingus worked as a studio musician, recording sessions for various artists including Benny Goodman and Louis Armstrong.\n", "\n", "> In the early 1950s, Mingus formed his own band, the Charles Mingus Seventh, which would become one of the most influential jazz groups of the time. The group's music was characterized by its complex harmonies, intricate rhythms, and Mingus's unique bass playing style, which combined elements of classical music with traditional jazz. Mingus's contributions to the music world were numerous, but perhaps his most important contribution was his role as a composer and arranger for various artists, including Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, and Chet Baker. His music also played a significant part in shaping the sound of 1960s jazz, influencing musicians such as Herbie Hancock and Wynton Marsalis.\n", "\n", "> One of Mingus's most important contributions to the music world was his concept of \"polyrhythms,\" which involved layering multiple rhythms on top of one another to create complex and intricate musical textures. This approach has been emulated by countless musicians since Mingus, and continues to influence jazz and other genres of music today. Mingus also made significant contributions to the development of the \"double bass\" (also known as the \"bass clarinet\"), a hybrid instrument that combines elements of both the double bass and the alto saxophone. His innovative use of this instrument has had a lasting impact on the world of jazz.\n", "\n", "> Throughout his long and prolific career, Mingus released over 60 albums, including the classic album \"Mingus Ah Um,\" which is widely regarded as one of the greatest jazz albums of all time. Mingus's music can be heard in numerous films, television shows, and commercials, and he continues to inspire new generations of musicians and fans alike. Despite his passing on May 15, 1979, Charles Mingus remains an important figure in the history of jazz, a true innovator and master of his craft who continues to shape the music world to this day.\n", "\n", "**&#167; Task:**  **Basic String functions.**\n", "\n", "Use the passage provided and answer the questions.  **Provide your answer in a Jupyter Notebook.**\n", "\n", "1.
